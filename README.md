# Cal-Curve-Check

This R script aims to perform Monte Carlo simulations for evaluating the probability of getting an out of specification result when checking the preparation of the calibration curve standard solutions.

In the pharmaceutical industry, this process is performed when the calibration curve is prepared by series dilutions of a standard stock solution (solution 1) to prepare the work standard solutions usually in a range from 80 - 120% of the API concentration in the drug product.

In order to check the preparation of the first standard work solution another standard stock solution (solution 2) and another work solution is prepared at a concentration close to the API concentration in the drug product.
